    "1. **Describing data**: Mean, variance, standard deviation — summarizing what your data looks like\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distributions**: The normal distribution, z-scores, and why standardization matters\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sample to population**: The sampling distribution, Central Limit Theorem, and standard error — understanding uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Confidence intervals**: Quantifying how precise our estimates are\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypothesis testing**: P-values, statistical significance, and effect sizes — evaluating evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Correlation**: Measuring relationships between variables (and its limitations)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Vectors and matrices**: Thinking geometrically about data, dot products, and cosine similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variability is the game**: Statistics is fundamentally about understanding and quantifying uncertainty\n",
    "- **Sample → Population is the key inference**: We almost never see the whole population\n",
    "- **p < 0.05 is not magic**: Always consider effect sizes alongside significance\n",
    "- **Correlation ≠ Causation**: One of the most important lessons in data analysis\n",
