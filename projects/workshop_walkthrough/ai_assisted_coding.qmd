# Installing GitHub

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for a GitHub account.

![](github_install.png)

At this page, you will sign up for GitHub with your `@berkeley.edu` email account. Follow the directions to verify your account. Below are some recommendations for creating a username (inspired by https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct).

-   Use part of your real name so it is easier for people to know who you are
-   Try and keep it short, you may have to type it a lot
-   Keep everything lowercase. If you really want to separate words, use a hyphen (-) or an underscore (\_)

Once you sign in, you will be at your dashboard. You will come back to GitHub shortly to copy the information for the workshop materials.
