This visualization was for a dashboard (see [here](https://jpedroza1228.github.io/gradschool_dashboard/)) in collaboration with the University of Oregon's Division of Graduate Studies. I met with the Vice Provost to discuss what was wanted for the dashboard. It was finally decided that a dashboard with visualizations and models examining the linear relationship between graduate students as teaching instructors and a metric of undergraduate student success. My role in this project was to clean and manipulate data for the visualizations in the dashboard. I also created synthetic data of the original data and summarized the original data to remove any chance of identifying individual graduate students. Summarized data files can be found [here](https://github.com/jpedroza1228/gradschool_dashboard/tree/main/pushable_data) while the synthethic data can be seen [here](https://github.com/jpedroza1228/gradschool_dashboard/tree/main/synthetic_data). My role also included creating the entire dashboard and conducting the growth model analyses, and interpreting and writing a summary for the Vice Provost in a manner that would be understandable to a less technical audience on the implications of having graduate students teaching rather than adjunct faculty or tenure-track faculty.  

The visualization presented here shows the average amount of full-time equivalency (FTE), or amount of time that graduate students could work, across departments at the university. Graduate employment ranges from those working approximately 10 hours a week to those that have a full-time graduate employment position at 20 hours a week. The FTE around .2 is usually from faculty hiring a graduate student for assistance with research that cannot fully hire a graduate student and pay for insurance and other benefits that is required when hiring at a .49 FTE. Some colleges cannot fully support the GEs in their departments, while others are able to fully support their graduate employees with grant-funded opportunities. That is why this visualization shows that the College of Arts & Sciences, a large college at the university, has several departments that can access grant funding, with averages being brought down in some departments due to also hiring part-time graduate employees. Additional graduate employment outside of each college and/or department also requires skills that are more likely to be present in colleges outside of the College of Design and the School of Music & Dance. For instance, graduate employment through the health center and the Division of Graduate Studies want employees with training in research, writing, and working with underserved populations; something that is common in many of the departments at higher average FTE ratings.
